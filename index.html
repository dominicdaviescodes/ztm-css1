    <p>We link to a stylesheet. We are also shown how we can use different stylesheets for different pages.</p>
    <h4>Separation of concerns</h4>
    <p>Styles and interaction are handled externally from the html files. This means the work can be done by different
      teams.</p>

    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>.class - good for selecting a group of elements to use the same style</li>
      <li>#id - use only once.</li>
      <li>* - quite rare. affects all elements. can be over ridden easily as * is usually at top and the cascade beats
        it.</li>
      <li>element</li>
      <li>element, element - if you want 2 elements to have same properties.</li>
      <li>element element - (h2 p) all p's inside h2's</li>
      <li>element > element - div > p Selects all p elements where the parent is a div element. nothing inbetween.
      </li>
      <li>element + element - div + p Selects all p elements that are placed immediately after div elements</li>
      <li>:hover a:hover Selects links on mouse over</li>
      <li>:last-child - p:last-child Selects every p element that is the last child of its parent</li>
      <li>:first-child - p:first-child Selects every <p> element that is the first child of its parent</li>
      <li>!important (not recommended). When an important rule is used on a style declaration, this declaration
        overrides any other declarations. Although technically !important has nothing to do with specificity, it
        interacts directly with it. Using !important, however, is bad practice and should be avoided because it makes
        debugging more difficult by breaking the natural cascading in your stylesheets. When two conflicting
        declarations with the !important rule are applied to the same element, the declaration with a greater
        specificity will be applied.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specificity - how specific is your selector, nested/detailed. inline wins, but bad practice.</li>
      <li>Importance - as above</li>
      <li>Source Order - multiple stylesheets, latest sheet wins.</li>
    </ul>
